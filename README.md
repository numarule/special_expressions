Regular Expressions++

### Feature Ideas
- Builder pattern for constructing regular expressions
- Structured Captures
  - [X] Start with function that returns named captures as `map[string]string`
    - (?<Player>[[:alnum:]]+: )
  - Indexed captures
  - Add sub-captures
    - Query sytnax similar to js objects 'Player.Position.X'
  - Output should support different dialects
